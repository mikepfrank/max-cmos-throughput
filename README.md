# Maximum CMOS Switching Throughput Density Estimator

This repository contains a simple MATLAB script that was used to compute a preliminary estimate of the maximum raw throughput density (logic node switching events per unit time and area) for conventional vs. fully adiabatic switching, as a function of allowed per-die power dissipation density, in various present/future CMOS technology nodes based on the [2022 edition](https://irds.ieee.org/editions/2022) of the [International Roadmap for Devices and Systems](https://irds.ieee.org/) (IRDS).

These results were reported in an invited talk titled "Limits of CMOS and Prospects for Adiabatic/Reversible CMOS," presented at the Texas Symposium on Computing with Emerging Technologies (ComET) on Oct. 30th, 2023. Talk [slides](https://www.sandia.gov/app/uploads/sites/210/2023/11/Comet23-slides_SAND.pdf) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vALCJJs9Dtw) are available.

This work was done by Alexander J. Edwards and Michael P. Frank in summer 2022 with some minor revisions in 2023. Funding for this work was provided by DOE through an [SCGSR Fellowship](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr) and the [Advanced Simulation and Computing](https://www.sandia.gov/asc/) program.
